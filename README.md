### TODO :

- [x] Forget about this project as I did it in 2 hours without real goal
- [ ] Find it back like 2 or 3 month later and think about what I will do with that ugly script
- [x] Actually that is exactly what happend so I remade it from scratch

---

### Q & A

- Is that legal ?

`IDK, but I don't think it is illegal`

- Why is that a fat ugly script ?

`Because it's one of the few scripts I can do without coding-style, so I do it without.`

- Is there any guarantee that the script works ?

`lol`
