# vpn-connect

---

Here is a simple python script to automate the connection to freeopenvpn.org.

---

## How to use ?

Simply run `./install_requirements.sh` to install... requirements :eyes:. (Please note that this script only works with apt-get. sorry fedora, ubuntu > )

After all requirements installed, launch the script with `./freeopenvpn_org.py` and follow the instructions.

### TODO :

- [x] Forget about this project as I did it in 2 hours without real goal
- [ ] Find it back like 2 or 3 month later and think about what I will do with that ugly script

---

### Q & A

- Is that legal ?

`IDK, if freeopenvpn want me to remove my repo, I'll do it, but for now it is.`

- Why is that a fat ugly script ?

`Because it's one of the few scripts I can do without coding-style, so I do it without.`

- Is there any guarantee that the script works ?

`lol`
